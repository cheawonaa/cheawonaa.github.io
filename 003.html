      <h3>Chang-E (2020)</h3>
      <p class="explanation">
        Chang-E is a organization which explores outside of the Earth to find the component that can make us live forever.<br>
        <br>
        This project is from a concept : images that we have seen with our eyes, and images that we haven't seen with our eyes.
        Even though we haven't seen it in person, there are images we still showing great belief in it.<br>
        I made a fake organization called 'Chang-E' which is inspired by myth of China's goddess and create story to make it believable.
        One of the example I took was NASA. We've never been to Universe but we believe them.<br>
        What kind of information they share with us?
        How much information they share with public?
        Is there specific method or visual way to convey their  achievements?
        Starting from these questions, I did visual research of believable images.<br>
        *ongoing project
