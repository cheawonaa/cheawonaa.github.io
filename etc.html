        Made by Studio yangpa. We, as a foreigner, see funny Korean printed t-shirts sometimes.<br>
        Usually, they don't make any sense, and sometimes they are very ridiculous words.<br>
        We translated one word into five languages and designed it to make them seemed cool.<br>
        But do you aware of what is on your t-shirt? You don't want to know it.
