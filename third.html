        This is a documentary about my father.<br> He has been worked in one company for almost 30 years.
        However, I still don't know what he is doing exactly. Moreover, this company is infamous for high security.
        By making this video, I got to know my father more and getting interesting secret facts about this company.
        I filmed with iPhone to give a spy cam feel. I recommend you to enjoy this video on your phone :)

      Since Corona virus's outbreak, I could not work at school or at my own room in Arnhem.<br>
      I flew back to South Korea and had to deal with difficulties. Diffrent time zone, No suitable place to work.
      I used to work from 11pm to 3am when I was in the Netherlands. so, I designed a working environment somewhere in the house
      that can generate the same productivity with me, which normally only the night time can offer.

        I made this work in collaboration with Sue Choi. We picked one random hero card and it was 'magician'.<br>
        We were the magicians having goodwill but unintentionally doom the world.<br>
        How can magicians who do graphic design can bring the apocalypse to the world?<br>
        Maybe drugs can be. We, magicians, create drugs for people's happiness but it seems not worked well.
