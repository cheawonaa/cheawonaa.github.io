        OASE #79 talks mainly about the architect, James Stirling.<br>
        He's interview shows how he was inspired and how he applied it to his work.
        I wanted to put a dreamy feeling with the format of a book. And wanted to make readers read it with appreciation.
        The yellow one is about James Stirling's imaginative idea part and Blue one is about how he translates those ideas into reality.

        Inspired from daily photo I took. Reflcted finger shape on a glass reminded me letter 'W'<br>
        Starting from that photo, I made few sketches and made this poster using my own typography 'Work'

        Using the article 'Brought To You By the Letter i' from Jessica Winter, I made a short book out of it.<br>
        The story treats letters as a human and portrait their story like an allegory. I really like that author treats them as living creatures.
        They are not only letters but also shapes.
        So I treated page numbers as a shape and took them to pieces when their duty is done.
        Every time a page passes, those page number shapes continue to pile up.

        Only using drawing, cutting and copying, I recreated images and make them into zine.<br>
        In the middie of the page, a2, a3, a5 spreads fit together and give you satisfaction.
